MRCS cpNode CMRI Kernel sketch

This sketch is the code template for a CMRI serial protocol node implemented in an Arduino style system board.  
The Modern Devices BBLeo, Bare Bones Leonardo (ATMega32u4) is the target Arduino style system board. 
  
Implements the CMRI Serial Protocol designed by Dr. Bruce Chubb and published publicly in various books, magazines, and articles.
  * The physical link is RS485, 4-wire, half duplex, serial.  
  * Each node has a one byte address in the range of 0-127.  
  * The Host polls the CMRI nodes for data.   
  * Port assignments represent the defined capability of a cpNode.
  * The base node data configuration is two bytes in, two bytes out.
  * All needed signal pins are connected via pin headers to the node board.
