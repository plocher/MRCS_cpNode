MRCS cpNode CMRI Kernel sketch

This is the code template for a CMRI serial protocol node implemented on an Arduino style system board.  
  * The Modern Devices BBLeo, Bare Bones Leonardo (ATMega32u4) is the original target Arduino style system board. 
  * v1.6 adds support for an Arduino Pro-Mini, although without the monitor serial port.
